## Reflections from the takehome challenge

( __UUID__: c1f56ae1-0d57-4271-882b-f9c25c9f3460â€‹ )

* ##### The instructions are extremely vague and they leave a lot of room for design and features.
  * The API doesn't support any sort of authentication, so I will assume the user has to have the browser window open to continue to see their tasks. If the browser window closes, the work is lost and they will start a new session upon visiting the site again.

  * I realized now that a user is authenticated via the UUID which is passed as a header.

* ##### I spent an embarassingly long time on the first day fixing a bug which made all my http requests fail.
  * Turns out when I copied the UUID from the email I received, a weird non-ISO 8859 character came with it at the very end but VS Code wasn't showing it.  

* ##### I have a lot of ideas on how to design a really enjoyable user experience, but I don't think I have the time to implement everything.
  * A kanban board to move all the completed tasks to would declutter the main pending tasks.
  * Initially, I was thinking about implementing a "Subtask" which is a subset of a "Task" since I believe it can help break down a complex task into smaller pieces. However, the API doesn't have support for that and it's there's no time to find a workaround.
  * I'm stil very unhappy about the design overall. I want to use more pre-made components to make it look a lot more stylish but I don't want to overwhelm such a small project with a bunch of libraries.

* ##### I finished implementing the 2 column kanban board and it makes it look much better. 
  * Luckily, I didn't have to implement anything new and just reused the same container. Upon clicking on the checkbox, the render cycle takes care of moving the task to the finished side.

* ##### The cards I'm using (from Material UI) really make the tasks look good but I think they can be slimmed down a bit more. There's a lot of white space.

* ##### Lastly, I was really unhappy with the style (color, title font of the application) so I just went with a nice colorful background.
  * Can't say I love it as the app's default theme colors but it is certainly less bland than the white/green that I was using before. It just looks cool to me right now.

  * I downloaded a cool font that kind of goes with the gradient vibe. I am happy with it at the moment.

* #### Overall, I really enjoyed building this little app. Thankfully, the API was well documented and I had no problem consuming it other than the silly mistake mentioned above.
