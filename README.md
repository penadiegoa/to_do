# TODO

Todo is a simple little app. It allows a user to enter, update, and delete items they 
need to complete and keep track of their completion status.

## Setup

To get started, you will want to review the backend API we have setup for you to use.
Head over to https://todo-api.cogb.us/docs to check out the documentation for the API. 
You will submit all your API calls to the appropriate endpoint on the same site 
(/docs is for documentation, /items is for the todos, etc.).


Your job is to get a nice UI around this API completed so users can manage their todo
lists more effectively. Remember to commit and push as often as possible, 
WE'D MUCH RATHER SEE AN INCOMPLETE RESPONSE THAN NOTHING AT ALL. Wherever you get 
to in the time limit, commit and push it.

## Reflection

We would like to know what you would do on this project if
given more time as well as what you thought the most and least
challenging parts of the project were. Please write some thoughts on
both of these topics in a file called `REFLECTION.md` (bulleted lists
are okay).

If you have any questions, issues with the API, or need clarification, please feel
free to reach out to Ben (ben@myndshft.com). 

Good luck and we look forward to seeing your submission!
