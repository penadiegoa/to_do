# TODO

Todo is a simple little app. It allows a user to enter items they need to complete and
keep track of their completion status.

## Setup

To get started, you will want to review the backend API we have setup for you to use.
Head over to https://todo-api.cogb.us/docs to check out the documentation for the API. 
You will submit all your API calls to the appropriate endpoint on the same site 
(/docs is for documentation, /items is for the todos, etc.).


Your job is to get a nice UI around this API completed so users can manage their todo
lists more effectively. Remember, we'd much rather see an incomplete response than 
nothing at all. Wherever you get to in the time limit, commit and push it.


If you have any questions, issues with the API, or need clarification, please feel
free to reach out to either Tyler (tyler@myndshft.com) or Kyle (kyle@myndshft.com).

Good luck and we look forward to seeing your submission!
